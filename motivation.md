### Description

Hello all, I’m Sebastian an AI Solution Architect. What that means? I conceptualize and realize AI solutions according to our clients’ ideas and business problems. This time I don’t want to work on somebody else idea but rather bring my own creativity into the game and develop my own visions.
I normally work in teams with specialists, let it be Data Scientists, Data and DevOps engineers and so on. This time however, I want to go about the project all by myself. 

Come with me on a journey through deep neural networks and revel with me over the nautical charts of ancient (and current) seafarers ;)

For my last sailing trip I had the problem to get the right nautical charts for the right islands I planned my journey to. So, I just used Google Maps. However, the style is not the same and information is mainly irrelevant for navigation. This is when I was reading a book called “Generative Deep Learning” by David Foster. Since that I am fascinated by the idea using deep learning, to generate sea maps, or at least a sea map style image from Google Maps images.

How I want to go about this?
I know about two ways of creating images of another style using ML. This is neural style transfer and cycle generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Whereas neural style transfer lets a fancy loss function do most of the magic, cycle GANs utilize a genius orchestration of neural networks that create and evaluate images. We want to find out what works good for this type of problem and see the results. We also want to check out the ideas behind the two approaches and apply it to this example.
